//5380. String Matching in an Array
//
//Difficulty:Easy
//Given an array of string words. Return all strings in words which is substring of another word in any order.
//
//String words[i] is substring of words[j], if can be obtained removing some characters to left and/or right side of words[j].
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
//Output: ["as","hero"]
//Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
//["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
//Output: ["et","code"]
//Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
//Example 3:
//
//Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
//Output: []
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= words.length <= 100
//1 <= words[i].length <= 30
//words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
//It's guaranteed that words[i] will be unique.

//5381. Queries on a Permutation With Key
//User Accepted:1344
//User Tried:1398
//Total Accepted:1352
//Total Submissions:1461
//Difficulty:Medium
//Given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m, you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules:
//
//In the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].
//For the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].
//Return an array containing the result for the given queries.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
//Output: [2,1,2,1]
//Explanation: The queries are processed as follow:
//For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5].
//For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5].
//For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5].
//For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5].
//Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].
//Example 2:
//
//Input: queries = [4,1,2,2], m = 4
//Output: [3,1,2,0]
//Example 3:
//
//Input: queries = [7,5,5,8,3], m = 8
//Output: [6,5,0,7,5]
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= m <= 10^3
//1 <= queries.length <= m
//1 <= queries[i] <= m

//5382. HTML Entity Parser
//User Accepted:0
//User Tried:0
//Total Accepted:0
//Total Submissions:0
//Difficulty:Medium
//HTML entity parser is the parser that takes HTML code as input and replace all the entities of the special characters by the characters itself.
//
//The special characters and their entities for HTML are:
//
//Quotation Mark: the entity is &quot; and symbol character is ".
//Single Quote Mark: the entity is &apos; and symbol character is '.
//Ampersand: the entity is &amp; and symbol character is &.
//Greater Than Sign: the entity is &gt; and symbol character is >.
//Less Than Sign: the entity is &lt; and symbol character is <.
//Slash: the entity is &frasl; and symbol character is /.
//Given the input text string to the HTML parser, you have to implement the entity parser.
//
//Return the text after replacing the entities by the special characters.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: text = "&amp; is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not."
//Output: "& is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not."
//Explanation: The parser will replace the &amp; entity by &
//Example 2:
//
//Input: text = "and I quote: &quot;...&quot;"
//Output: "and I quote: \"...\""
//Example 3:
//
//Input: text = "Stay home! Practice on Leetcode :)"
//Output: "Stay home! Practice on Leetcode :)"
//Example 4:
//
//Input: text = "x &gt; y &amp;&amp; x &lt; y is always false"
//Output: "x > y && x < y is always false"
//Example 5:
//
//Input: text = "leetcode.com&frasl;problemset&frasl;all"
//Output: "leetcode.com/problemset/all"
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= text.length <= 10^5
//The string may contain any possible characters out of all the 256 ASCII characters.

//Difficulty:Hard
//You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colours: Red, Yellow or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same colour (i.e no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same colour).
//
//You are given n the number of rows of the grid.
//
//Return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 10^9 + 7.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: n = 1
//Output: 12
//Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown:
//
//Example 2:
//
//Input: n = 2
//Output: 54
//Example 3:
//
//Input: n = 3
//Output: 246
//Example 4:
